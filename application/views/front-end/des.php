                <ul class="list theme-colored2 paper">
                  <li><h6>Webinars-</h6>We conduct over 65+ lectures which are over 150+ hours of quality coaching for PCE in Musculoskeletal, Cardiopulmonary, Neurology, Non-systems and Multi-systems by our dedicated and qualified professionals in their fields. They are extremely cost effective and suits one’s pockets. Our webinars are interactive, goal oriented and simplified for better understanding and grasping of the knowledge of the students. The duration of our one batch is for approximately 2.5 months. During this tenure you will receive an invitation everyday via email to access the live lecture as per the schedule. You can type in the chat box if you have any doubts or questions related to the topic that will be taught during the live session. So, it will be a group class and not one on one. <br>
                  <b>(Note: You need internet connection to attend the lectures and watch the recordings)</b></li>
                  <li><h6>Timings -</h6>Classes are usually scheduled in the evenings between 7:00 or 8:00 pm EST (New York time/Toronto time) during the weekdays and few in the mornings as well on weekends for 1-1.5 hours depending upon the topics. We make a new schedule with every session, so it will be available only 2 days before the commencement of the program.</li>
                  <li><h6>Strategy Class -</h6>We conduct strategy classes during our tenure of 2.5 months of a batch. This guides the students on the question solving with rationales, test taking strategies, and time management. These classes give the students a right perspective towards the test.</li>
                  <!--<li><h6>Syllabus -</h6>We cover all the detailed syllabus of musculoskeletal, cardiopulmonary, neurology, non-systems and multi-systems as per the requirement and blueprints of Canadian Alliance of Physiotherapy Regulators (CAPR).</li>-->
                  <li><h6>Mentorship -</h6>We also offer one on one mentoring programs if you find it difficult to follow our general study plans. We have 3-4 trained instructors excelling in their fields, which give individual attention and guidance, strategic problem solving, brainstorming questions and discussions of the rationales and the test results. They help in chalking out a more personalized study plan designed to serve as per individual needs.</li>
                  <li><h6>Mock tests -</h6> This course provides 2 full timely mock tests with rationale and feedback – one standalone and one vignette style test. Vignette style is an exact replica of the PCE test conducted by CAPR. Apart from full 200 questions test we also provide topic wise weekly tests. This gives the students a better knowledge of their preparation and area of weakness.</li>
                  <li><h6>Validity -</h6>We have four rotational batches throughout the year. You are welcome to join in the course anytime in between as we do not limit the number of time or lectures that you can attend. Our course validity is for one year or till you pass the test, whichever happens first. There is no midway policy change. Isn’t that a great to deal to grab on!!</li>

                  We also have a WhatsApp discussion group, which lets the students have a discussion on varied topics as per their ease.<br>
